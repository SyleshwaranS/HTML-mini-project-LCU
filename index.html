    <h3>Welcome to the world of Lokesh Cinematic Universe</h3></center>
    <div style="border: 2px solid black;background-color:lightgray;">
        <center><h2>Vikram</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/vikram.webp" alt="Agent Vikram" width="500px" height="500px"></center>
        
        <p>Vikram is a former RAW agent and the former leader of a covert black ops unit. In Vikram (2022), 
            he operates under the alias Karnan and fakes his death as part of a master plan to dismantle a dangerous 
            drug cartel operating in Tamil Nadu. After losing his son Prabhanjan (a sincere police officer killed by 
            the drug mafia), Vikram goes underground and reignites his old black ops team to seek justice. Using his 
            intelligence, combat expertise, and strategic brilliance, Vikram begins eliminating those responsible for 
            his son's death and targets the larger drug network, especially Sandhanam (played by Vijay Sethupathi), 
            who is linked to the powerful drug lord Rolex (played by Suriya). 
            Despite being presumed dead, Vikram reemerges as a fearless vigilante, operating outside the system to 
            root out crime. His actions inspire others like Amar (Fahadh Faasil), a government agent, to join his 
            cause. Vikram is not just a fighter but a symbol of rebellion against corruption and organized crime. 
            His mission sets the stage for a bigger war within the LCU and connects deeply with the events of 
            Kaithi (2019) and future films. Vikram’s character is the soul of the universe — a battle-scarred warrior 
            turned shadow protector, orchestrating a silent revolution.</p>

        <center><h2>Dhili</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/dhili.jpg" alt="Dhili" width="500px" height="600px"></center>
        
        <p>Dilli is an ex-convict who has just been released from prison after serving a long sentence and 
            wishes for nothing more than to reunite with his daughter, whom he has never met. However, on the 
            night of his release, he gets unwillingly pulled into a dangerous mission by the police. A massive 
            drug mafia is on a violent spree to recover confiscated narcotics from a police station, and Dilli 
            ends up becoming the unlikely hero who helps a group of injured police officers survive the night. 
            With exceptional bravery, street smarts, and raw combat skills, Dilli transports the officers while 
            fending off relentless attacks from gang members. His actions not only save lives but also expose 
            the scale and danger of the drug cartel operating in Tamil Nadu. Though initially uninterested in 
            heroism or justice, Dilli becomes a symbol of sacrifice and redemption. His story directly ties into
             the broader conflict seen in Vikram (2022), where the same drug syndicate (run by Rolex, played by 
             Suriya) is further explored. Dilli’s heroics put him on the radar of powerful criminal networks, 
             suggesting that he could play a major role in future LCU films, especially as the universe heads 
             toward a larger war between vigilantes and drug lords.

        <center><h2>Amar</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/fafa.jpg" alt="" width="450px" height="750px"></center>
        
        <p>In the movie Vikram (2022), the character Amar, played by Fahadh Faasil, is a crucial part
             of the narrative. He is introduced as the leader of a black ops team tasked with investigating 
             a series of mysterious killings, including that of a man named Karnan. Initially portrayed as a 
             sharp, ruthless officer who believes in results over rules, Amar begins to suspect there is more 
             to Karnan’s identity. As his investigation deepens, he uncovers that Karnan is actually Vikram, 
             a former RAW agent who had faked his death and is now covertly fighting against a powerful drug 
             syndicate. This revelation becomes a turning point for Amar, who undergoes a significant moral 
             transformation. Realizing the larger mission Vikram is on, Amar shifts his allegiance and 
             ultimately joins forces with him, becoming an important ally in the battle against organized
            crime. His journey from a system-serving officer to a supporter of Vikram’s vigilante justice adds 
            depth to his character and sets him up for a larger role in the expanding 
            Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU).

        <center><h2>Rolex</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/rolex.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px"></center>
        
        <p>Rolex is the shadowy kingpin who runs the massive international drug cartel operating behind the 
            scenes in both Vikram (2022) and Kaithi (2019). He is the man whom other crime lords — including 
            Sandhanam — fear and work for. Rolex appears in the climax of Vikram when the surviving members of the 
            cartel report to him after their empire is disrupted by Vikram and his team. Despite being on screen for
             just a few minutes, Rolex's character leaves a chilling impact — he brutally murders those who failed him, 
             showcasing his violent nature, zero tolerance for disobedience, and absolute dominance. He is portrayed as 
             the ultimate villain in the LCU — someone more dangerous than anyone introduced so far. His operations 
             involve large-scale drug manufacturing and distribution, and he has informants and hitmen deeply embedded
            in the system. Vikram’s war against Sandhanam indirectly threatens Rolex’s empire, and by the end of the 
            film, Rolex marks Vikram and his allies as targets. This sets up Rolex to be the main antagonist in future 
            LCU installments, possibly leading to a massive showdown involving Vikram, Dilli, Amar, and others.</p>

        <center><h2>Santhanam</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/vjs.webp" alt="" width="300px" height="600px"></center>
        
        <p>Santhanam is a brutal and power-hungry drug lord who runs a major part of the illegal narcotics network 
            in Tamil Nadu. He works under the larger crime syndicate controlled by Rolex and is responsible for 
            smuggling and protecting huge quantities of raw materials used to make drugs. Cunning and violent, 
            Santhanam keeps a personal army of armed men and has high-tech hideouts, including an underground lab. 
            His character is unpredictable — both insane and intelligent — and he's shown to be addicted to drugs 
            himself. Santhanam is directly responsible for several key deaths in Vikram, including that of Prabhanjan 
            (Vikram's son), which fuels Vikram’s mission of revenge. Despite his resources, Santhanam underestimates 
            Vikram’s capabilities and is eventually hunted down. His failure to protect Rolex’s goods is one of the 
            reasons the bigger syndicate begins to collapse. Santhanam represents the face of local organized crime, 
            and his fallsignals a shift in power — drawing the attention of Rolex and leading to greater conflict in the LCU.</p>

        <center><h2>Anbu</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/arjundas.jpg" alt="" width="450px" height="500px"></center>
        
        <p>Anbu is a cold-blooded and ambitious gangster who operates under the larger drug cartel that’s later 
            revealed to be controlled by Rolex. In Kaithi, he attempts to recover a massive drug consignment that 
            the police have seized and stored inside a secret chamber at the police station. Despite being relatively 
            young, Anbu is shown to be fearless, extremely violent, and strategic — he doesn't hesitate to kill, 
            manipulate, or threaten to get what he wants. Throughout the night, he leads a coordinated assault on 
            the police force, aiming to break into the station and retrieve the drugs. However, his plans are thwarted 
            by Dilli, an ex-convict who defends the police and transports injured officers across dangerous zones. 
            Anbu ultimately faces Dilli in a brutal final fight and is killed, 
            but his actions expose the depth and boldness of the criminal network operating across the state.</p>

        <center><h2>Inspector Bejoy</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/naren.jpg" alt=""width="500px" height="500px"></center>
        
        <p>Inspector Bejoy is one of the few honest and brave cops in the LCU, known for his calm intelligence and 
            tactical mindset. In Kaithi, he leads a covert operation to seize a huge consignment of drugs from a 
            hidden cartel warehouse. To protect the confiscated narcotics, he drugs an entire team of police officers 
            at a party so they won’t leak the mission. However, when the mafia retaliates to retrieve the drugs, Bejoy
            is severely injured early in the movie. With the help of Dilli, an ex-convict who steps up as a protector
            , Bejoy guides the night-long defense mission via phone, showcasing his leadership and commitment even 
            while injured. He survives and reappears in Vikram (2022), continuing his fight against the drug mafia. 
            In Vikram, Bejoy is shown working with Vikram’s son Prabhanjan, and they both become targets of the 
            criminal network. Tragically, Prabhanjan is killed, and Bejoy is attacked and hospitalized — but survives
            again. His persistence and connection to both 
            Dilli and Vikram make him a key supporting character who holds the threads of both films together.</p>

        <center><h2>Constable Napoleon</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/napolean.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px"></center>
        
        <p>In Kaithi (2019), Constable Napoleon is one of the few honest and loyal police officers who stands by 
            Inspector Bejoy during the critical night when the drug mafia attempts to reclaim their massive 
            consignment from the police. Napoleon is assigned to protect the injured officers who are unconscious 
            and under threat. Despite being an older, lower-ranking officer, Napoleon shows immense courage, 
            resilience, and emotional strength. He teams up with a group of college students and helps defend the 
            police station against multiple waves of attacks. His character is not just comic relief but also deeply 
            human — emotional, brave, and determined to do what’s right, no matter the risk. Napoleon’s actions play 
            a major part in saving the lives of fellow officers and civilians. Though he doesn’t appear in Vikram, 
            his loyalty to duty and connection to Bejoy tie him into the moral foundation of the LCU.</p>

        <center><h2>Leo</h2></center>
        <center><img src="./images/leo.webp" alt="" width="500px" height="500px"></center>
        
        <p>In Leo, Vijay plays Parthiban, a calm and simple café owner in Kashmir who lives with his wife and children.
             However, when violent events unfold, his hidden past resurfaces. It’s revealed that he was once Leo Das, 
             the son of Antony Das (Sanjay Dutt), a dangerous gangster involved in arms, drugs, and violent crimes. 
             Leo had distanced himself from the criminal empire, but is pulled back into conflict due to a series of 
             events — leading to speculation and debate about whether he's truly left that life behind. While Leo 
             focuses on his personal battle with family legacy, key LCU elements are embedded throughout the film, 
             including references to Rolex's drug network, the cross-border smuggling, and stylistic choices that 
             match the universe's tone. Although Rolex doesn’t appear, the thematic and 
            narrative alignment strongly hints that Leo will eventually clash with, or be hunted by, the syndicate.</p>
